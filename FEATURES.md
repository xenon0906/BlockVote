# Features Documentation

Detailed explanation of all features in the Blockchain Voting System.

## 1. Auto Wallet Connection

- Automatically detects installed wallets (MetaMask, WalletConnect, Coinbase Wallet)
- One-click connection with RainbowKit integration
- Remembers connection for future visits
- Supports multiple wallet providers

### Supported Wallets
- MetaMask
- WalletConnect (mobile wallets)
- Coinbase Wallet
- Any injected Web3 wallet

### Technical Implementation
```typescript
// Uses Wagmi v2 + RainbowKit for seamless connection
- Auto-reconnect on page refresh

- Account switching detection
```

## 2. Poll Creation System

### Create Global Polls
Anyone can create a poll with custom parameters:

**Poll Parameters:**
- **Title**: Name of the poll
- **Description**: Detailed information
- **Duration**: Days the poll will run (customizable)
- **Max Candidates**: Limit for candidate registration
- **Voting Fee**: ETH amount per vote (winner's reward source)

### Smart Features
- Automatic start time recording
- Precise end time calculation
- On-chain storage of all data
- Gas-optimized storage

### Example Use Cases
- Community elections
- Product decisions
- DAO governance
- Contest voting
- Opinion polls

## 3. Competitive Candidate System

### Standard Registration
When slots are available:
1. Click "Add Candidate"
2. Enter your name
3. Confirm transaction (small gas fee)
4. You're registered!

### Candidate Replacement
When slots are FULL, you can still join:

**Process:**
1. Choose a candidate to replace
2. Enter your name
3. Set payment amount in ETH
4. Pay the existing candidate
5. Take their spot!

**Why This Matters:**
- Keeps polls competitive
- Candidates can earn ETH from replacements
- Creates market dynamics
- Rewards early participants

**Example:**
```
Poll has 5 slots, all filled
→ You want to join
→ Pay Candidate #3: 0.01 ETH
→ Candidate #3 accepts payment
→ You replace them and start with 0 votes
```

## 4. Transparent Voting

### How Voting Works
1. Browse active polls
2. View all candidates
3. Click "Vote" on your choice
4. Pay the voting fee
5. Vote recorded on blockchain

### Vote Features
- One vote per address per poll
- Immutable once cast
- Publicly verifiable
- Live vote count updates

### Voting Fee Distribution
When poll ends:
- **90%** → Winner (automatic)
- **10%** → Platform (transparent, not hidden)

**Example:**
```
100 voters × 0.001 ETH = 0.1 ETH total
Winner receives: 0.09 ETH
Platform receives: 0.01 ETH
```

## 5. Poll Deletion & Refunds

### When to Delete
- Low participation
- Poll created by mistake
- Community request
- Invalid candidates

### Who Can Delete

- Platform owner (emergencies only)

### Refund Process
**Automatic for voters:**
1. Poll gets deleted
2. All votes invalidated
3. Voters claim refunds
4. Full voting fee returned

**Example:**
```
Poll deleted with 50 voters
Each voter can claim their 0.001 ETH back
No penalties, full refund guaranteed
```

## 6. Trending Polls System

### How Rankings Work
Polls ranked by **interactions**:
- Each vote = +1 interaction
- Each candidate registration = +1 interaction
- Each replacement = +1 interaction

### Top 3 Display
- Real-time updates
- Shown on homepage
- Badge indicators (#1, #2, #3)
- Special highlighting

### Benefits
- Discover popular polls
- See community engagement
- Find active communities
- Trending badges for visibility

## 7. Active & Completed Polls

### Active Polls
**Criteria:**
- Currently accepting votes
- End time not reached
- Not deleted
- Has candidates

**Features:**
- Full voting enabled
- Candidate addition allowed
- Live vote counts
- Replacement available

### Completed Polls
**Shown for 24 Hours:**

## 8. Status Bar Analytics

### Real-Time Metrics
Displayed at top of homepage:

**Total Polls**
- All polls ever created
- Includes active, completed, deleted

**Active Polls**
- Currently running
- Accepting votes now

**Completed**
- Ended in last 24 hours
- Winners announced

**Total Votes**
- Global vote count
- Across all polls
- All-time statistic

### Technical Implementation
```solidity
// Updated on every transaction
getTotalStats() public view returns (
    uint256 totalPolls,
    uint256 totalActivePolls,
    uint256 totalCompletedPolls,
    uint256 totalVotesGlobal
)
```

## 9. Leaderboard System

### Rankings Based On
1. **Total Votes Cast**: Participation count
2. **Rewards Won**: ETH earned from winning
3. **Polls Won**: Number of victories

### Leaderboard Features
- Top voters highlighted
- Gold/Silver/Bronze badges
- ETH rewards displayed
- Wallet addresses shown
- Participation statistics

### How to Rank Up
- Vote in more polls
- Win polls (be a candidate)
- Participate consistently
- Engage with popular polls

## 10. Duration Management

### Customizable Durations
Poll creators set duration in days:
- Minimum: 1 day
- Recommended: 3-7 days
- Maximum: No limit (but practical limits apply)

### Automatic Handling
- End time calculated on creation
- No manual intervention needed
- Timezone-independent (uses block timestamp)
- Precise to the second

### Poll Lifecycle
```
Created → Active → Ended → Results → Archived (24h)
```

## 11. Reward Distribution

### Automatic Distribution
When poll ends:
1. System calculates winner (most votes)
2. Computes 90% of total pool
3. Transfers to winner's address
4. Records in leaderboard
5. Shows in completed polls

### Transparent Math
```
Total Pool = votes × voting fee
Winner Reward = Total Pool × 0.9
Platform Fee = Total Pool × 0.1
```

### Why 90/10 Split?
- **90%** to winner: Main incentive
- **10%** for platform: Maintenance, gas optimization
- **Fully transparent**: Visible in smart contract
- **Industry standard**: Common in DeFi/Web3

## 12. Poll Interaction Tracking

### What Counts as Interaction?
- Voting on a poll
- Adding yourself as candidate
- Replacing a candidate
- Viewing poll details (frontend only)

### Why Track Interactions?
- Measure engagement
- Calculate trending
- Show activity level
- Reward active polls

### Usage in System
```typescript
// Trending algorithm
trendingScore = totalInteractions
sortedPolls = polls.sort((a, b) =>
    b.totalInteractions - a.totalInteractions
)
```

## 13. Sepolia Testnet Integration

### Why Sepolia?
- **Free**: No real money needed
- **Fast**: Quick confirmations
